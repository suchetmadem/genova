  <h1>About Genova Global</h1>
  <p>
    At Genova Global, we believe the next generation of scholars doesn't just need to read
    about the world—they need to build it. We are dedicated to sparking a lifelong passion
    for STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering, and Math) in youth through bridging the gap
    between just watching videos and real hands-on work.
  </p>

  <h2>Our Mission</h2>
  <p>
    To inspire and equip young minds with the critical thinking, creativity, and technical
    skills necessary to navigate a rapidly changing world due to constant innovation. We
    strive to make high-quality STEM knowledge accessible, inclusive, and—above all—hands-on.
  </p>

  <h2>What We Do</h2>
  <p>We move beyond the classroom to provide immersive, project-based experiences that empower students to become active problem-solvers. Our initiatives include:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>
      <strong>Research articles:</strong> Members are given a unique opportunity to work on a
      research article with complete freedom as to the topic, with the stipulation that it be
      related to one of the STEM fields.
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Real-World Projects:</strong> We challenge youth to tackle their everyday
      challenges through ideas that they learn in workshops in Genova.
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Mentorship &amp; Community:</strong> We work to provide members with access to
      internship opportunities with companies related to their specific field in STEM and
      even offer some of our own.
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Inclusive Outreach:</strong> We are committed to reaching under-resourced
      communities, ensuring that every child, regardless of background, has the opportunity
      to lead in the 21st-century world and take it by storm.
    </li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Our Vision</h2>
  <p>
    To cultivate a globally competent workforce of "action takers" who use science and
    technology to create sustainable solutions for their local and global communities.
