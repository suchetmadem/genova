      <p class="about-text">
        At Genova Global, we believe the next generation of scholars doesn't just need to read
        about the world—they need to build it. We are dedicated to sparking a lifelong passion
        for STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering, and Math) in youth through bridging the gap
        between just watching videos and real hands-on work.
