      <h1>About Genova Global</h1>
      <p>
        At Genova Global, we believe the next generation of scholars doesn&apos;t just need
        to read about the world—they need to build it. We are dedicated to sparking a
        lifelong passion for STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering, and Math) in youth
        through bridging the gap between just watching videos and real hands-on work.
